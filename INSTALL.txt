Note: ssh -Y onto ugclinux server to test code, must have X11 port fowarding to 
open gui

Build files: run 'make build' (will generate _build file)

Install OPAM packages: run 'make deps'

In order to test implemented functionality in utop: 
  1) run 'make' (will generate _build file)
  2) run 'let board = Board.init_board;;' to initialize chess board [board]
  3) run 'Board.print_board board' to visualize [board]
  4) run 'Board.positions board' to see all the legal moves on a chess board
     Example: White Rook starts at ('a',1)
  5) run 'Move.legal_moves <position of piece that you want move> board' to see
     a list of legal of moves for that the piece in that position
  6) run 'Move.move <position of piece that you want move> <position that you
     want to move the piece to> board' to move a piece
     Note: Illegal moves will raise an IllegalMove exception
  7) run 'Board.print_board board' to visualize updated [board]
  8) Repeat steps 5 - 7

In order to test implemented functionality in terminal:
  1) run 'make play' (will generate _build file)
  2) type 'instructions' as a command to see how to play
  3) play

In order to run our test: run 'make test' (will generate _build file)
