When we first started this project, we had planned to implement a 
non-terminal GUI system. We had already written the initial board, which was 
around 150 lines of code. Adding the pieces and movements on the board
would have added more code; however, we got stuck while trying to load
images, so we had to ditch this idea and switch to a terminal GUI. This 
cost us hundreds of lines of expected code, which is why our LOC is less than 
~2000.
